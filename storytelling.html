			Since the beginning of time, storytelling has brought people together through entertainment and education and Vivian Harries keeps this rich tradition alive. As “Lady Vivian of Camelot,” Vivian enchants children of all ages through her fun and delightful way of storytelling. From school-aged children to senior citizens, her stories not only entertain, but foster learning, as well. 
			Her program contains several folk and fairy tales told with props and visual aids. She not only entertains her audiences, but also includes bits of history and asks questions to encourage her audience to think and learn.
